      "question": "Which of the following is NOT a common technique used in Natural Language Processing (NLP)?",
      "answer": "B",
      "explanation": "While backpropagation is a crucial algorithm for training neural networks, which are often used *in* NLP, it's not a direct technique *of* NLP itself. Tokenization, Named Entity Recognition, and Sentiment Analysis are all core NLP techniques.",
      "options": [
        "A. Tokenization",
        "B. Backpropagation",
        "C. Named Entity Recognition",
        "D. Sentiment Analysis"
      ]
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the primary difference between supervised and unsupervised learning in the context of AI?",
      "answer": "A",
      "explanation": "The core distinction lies in the data used. Supervised learning algorithms train on labeled datasets (input-output pairs), allowing them to predict outputs for new inputs. Unsupervised learning algorithms work with unlabeled data, identifying patterns and structures without explicit guidance.",
      "options": [
        "A. Supervised learning uses labeled data, while unsupervised learning uses unlabeled data.",
        "B. Supervised learning is used for classification, while unsupervised learning is used for regression.",
        "C. Supervised learning requires less computational power than unsupervised learning.",
        "D. Supervised learning creates generative models, while unsupervised learning creates discriminative models."

    {
      "question": "In reinforcement learning, what is the role of the 'agent'?",
      "answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The agent is the learner and decision-maker in reinforcement learning. It explores the environment, takes actions, receives feedback (rewards or penalties), and adjusts its strategy to maximize cumulative rewards over time. It's not a passive observer, doesn't define the rewards, and isn't pre-programmed with optimal behavior.",
      "options": [
        "A. To passively observe the environment and record data.",
        "B. To define the rewards and penalties for different actions.",
        "C. To interact with the environment and learn optimal actions through trial and error.",
        "D. To pre-program the optimal behavior for a specific task."
